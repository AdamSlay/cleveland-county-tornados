# norman-tornados
Jupyter Notebook exploring the frequency of Tornados in Norman, OK

When making this notebook, I was mainly trying to experiment with meterological data in a meaningful way, and I thought what better way to do that than to address the mythical Tornado Bubble surrounding Norman, OK.
In this report you'll find that since statistics regarding the exact location of tornadoes became reasonably accurate and not simply based on hearsay, Cleveland County has seen relatively few tornados compared to surrounding counties.
The data is certainly interesting, but ultimately inconclusive. This was a fun exercise in data visualization and the use of Jupyter Notebooks. 


### Viewing Static Version
To simply view a static version of the report click on the ```norman-tors.ipynb``` file right here in the GitHub repo.


### Running Jupyter Notebook
To run the Jupyter Notebook in the browser you need to make sure you have Jupyter Notebooks installed:
```shell
pip3 install notebook
```

Then to launch the notebook in the browser, navigate to the directory containing the ```norman-tors.ipynb``` file and run:
```shell
jupyter notebook
```

This will launch a new window in your browser where you can navigate to the ```norman-tors.ipynb``` file to view a running Jupyter Notebook.
