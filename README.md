# norman-tornados
Jupyter Notebook exploring the frequency of Tornados in Norman, OK

When making this notebook, I was mainly trying to experiment with meterological data in a meaningful way, and I thought what better way to do that than to address the mythical Tornado Bubble surrounding Norman, OK.
In this report you'll find that since statistics regarding the exact location of tornadoes became reasonably accurate and not simply based on hearsay, Cleveland County has seen relatively few tornados compared to surrounding counties.
The data is certainly interesting, but ultimately inconclusive. This was a fun exercise in data visualization and the use of Jupyter Notebooks. 

To view the report simply click on the ```norman-tors.ipynb``` file.
